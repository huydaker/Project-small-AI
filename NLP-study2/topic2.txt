Some US politicians ask university presidents about antisemitic incidents. These are three universities. Problems start after Hamas attacks Israel on October 7.
The presidents strongly disagree with the attack. They say that Jewish students are safe. But they also say that free speech is important. Some universities, especially Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, do not react fast enough to antisemitic incidents. At least some people say that.
