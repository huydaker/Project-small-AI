China has new rules for travelers. They start on December 1. These rules should help tourism.
Officials will make travel easier. People from some countries do not need visas anymore. Officials will change the rules if it is necessary. In the first three days of December, 7,000 visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Malaysia come to China. Daily tourist numbers from these places go up by 39% compared to the end of November. This helps Chinaâ€™s tourism after COVID-19.
